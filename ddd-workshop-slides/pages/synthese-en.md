## Domain Driven Design

<br>
<br>
<br>

<v-click>

The DDD <span v-mark.red="2">methodology</span> offers a <span v-mark.red="3">set of practices</span> for a
collaborative approach to software
development,
from the perspective of <span v-mark.circle.orange="4"> the business </span>.

## Domain Driven Design

<br>
<br>
<br>

<h3 v-click>Not a framework...</h3>
<h3 v-click>more like a toolbox</h3>
<h3 v-click>not only code</h3>

Everything was already there.
The importance of strategic patterns to understand the domain before starting the solution.
We made explicit everything that was implicit in our heads.

## Warnings

<br>
<br>
<br>

<h3 v-click>Not a silver bullet</h3>
<h3 v-click>sometimes CRUD is more relevant</h3>
<h3 v-click>easy to understand hard to master</h3>
<h3 v-click>iterative</h3>
<h3 v-click>be careful of the "by the book"</h3>

## What about legacy code?

<br>
<br>
<br>

<h3 v-click>use value object</h3>
<h3 v-click>move invariants</h3>
<h3 v-click>identify and isolate bounded contexts</h3>

<!--
How to migrate a legacy to DDD?
You don't have to use all DDD patterns.
- Start with the simplest: value objects. 
- Is it possible to move business invariants into entities?
- Clearly identify Bounded Contexts
- Isolate Bounded Contexts
- Use Strangler pattern
